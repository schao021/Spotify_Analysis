# Spotify Analysis

## Introduction
This project explores a dataset of over 100,000 Spotify tracks to uncover trends in song characteristics, genre behaviors, and popularity patterns. Using Python libraries like `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`, the analysis combines data cleaning, statistical insights, and visual storytelling.

## Key Questions

- What makes a song popular on Spotify?
- Are explicit songs generally more successful?
- How do different audio features like energy, valence, and danceability relate to each other?
- Do certain genres contain longer or more energetic tracks?

## Techniques Used

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, filtering noisy data
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics, grouped comparisons
- **Visualizations**: Line plots, histograms, boxplots, heatmaps
- **Feature Exploration**: Analyzing relationships between audio features and song popularity
- **Genre-Level Insights**: Examining how song duration and popularity vary across genres

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3.12** — Main programming language
- **Pandas** — Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** — Core plotting library for visualizations
- **Seaborn** — Statistical data visualization built on top of matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook** — Interactive environment for running and presenting code- `matplotlib`
